# Body Mass Calculation Tool 

During the course "Developing Data Products", we were asked to :
- create and deploy a Shiny Application using Rstudio's servers.  
- create a presentation about the application using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter, 
- Publish the application using shinyapp.io
- Publish the presentation using Rpubs or Github (gh-pages)

The application must include the following:

- Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
- Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
- Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
- Enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
- The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. 

In this repository, I share server.R and ui.R files.
